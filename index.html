            <p>While you may know a little about climate change and the issues it is causing, you may think everyone contributes somewhat equally. You may think that yes, some people do their best to not contribute while others do not care. While this may be true, depending on where you live, the contributors may be different and your country's overall production of pollution may vary. Depending on the country, more may have to be done than simply biking to work and installing solar panels.</p>

            <p>While you should be trying your hardest to make your own living more sustainable, you can't do everything on your own. You can't change how sustainable your house was built, you can't change vehicle-centric city layouts, and you might not be able to afford solar panels. You can't fight climate change on your own, but if everyone groups together and fights for it, the things that you couldn't change on your own will change and improve.</p>
