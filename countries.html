            <p>Now, basically every country on Earth contributes to climate change. Everyone needs power, everyone needs fuel, everyone needs something and that something usually releases pollutants. But which countries have the most impact? You may believe it is the less-developed countries, as they have less resources to access more renewable energy sources, and while this is true, they are not the greatest polluters.</p>

In addition to this, many places in China have terrible working environments that are poorly </p>
