            <p>Now, basically every country on Earth contributes to climate change. Everyone needs power, everyone needs fuel, everyone needs something and that something usually releases pollutants. But which countries have the most impact? You may believe it is the less-developed countries, as they have less resources to access more renewable energy sources, and while this is true, they are not the greatest polluters.<br>That would be China, the US, and India. Why? Well, for one, they are the most populous countries. India has the largest population, followed by China and the US. This causes them to require significantly more energy, agricultural output, industry, exports and imports, transportation, infrastructure, and more. All of these factors cause them to produce the most emissions in the world. But that's not the only reason.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/interactive-chart-shows-changes-worlds-top-10-emitters" target="_blank">Source</a>. EU (27) is the entire EU.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Let's start with China. Ever since industrialization, China has relied heavily on coal. In addition to this, due to its rapid growth, China's industrial production is incredibly poor in terms of regulation, causing it to be significantly more polluting than it would otherwise. On a positive note, China is currently working as much as it can to cut down on this pollution, leading to its production beginning to fall.<br>Next on the list, the United States. The main reason for the US's emissions is power generation. While America does have renewable sources of energy, those sources make up a tiny fraction of the electricity generation. In addition to this, the US's power plants are old. Around 2/3rds of the power plants in the US were built before the 1980s. These old power plants are significantly less efficient when it comes to power generation, and thus produce more emissions (specifically CO<sub>2</sub>) than newer plants.</p>
                <p>The US has introduced laws and regulations in order to combat these issues, which have been very successful. However, the Trump administration has repealed many of those regulations and more, leaving the Paris Agreement, cutting regulations on many polluting fuel sources, revived the coal industry, and removing many laws that provided education on the effects of the environment. This has undone some of the progress the US has made.<br>Finally, India. India has many of the same problems that China does, but much worse. India is the most populated country in the world, and that, along with other things, brings many environmental challenges. For starters, traffic in India is incredibly bad. A combination of a lack of proper public transport in many cities, terrible road planning and management, a larger amount of poeple buying cars, and more, have all contributed. This results in very slow traffic that can be quite risky to human health and safety and pumps out a large amount of automobile pollution into the air.</p>

            <p>In addition to this, India uses large amounts of biomass and wood for power and heating. Approximately 41% of India still uses biomass and wood for such purposes. India is the largest consumer of fuelwood, agricultural waste, and biomass for energy. However, the government of India is taking action. It is revising its ambient air quality standards, strengthening vehicle and industrial emmission standards, expanding renewable energy, promoting electric vehicles, supplying less polluting cooking fuel to millions of households, and more. They have also introduced the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) to set a time-sensitive goal to solve the air quality issue. On top of this, the 15th Finace Commission recommended the government use $1.7 billion to combat climate change, which they did. However, according to the <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/india/#:~:text=per%2Dcapita%20emissions.-,Overall%20rating%20Highly%20insufficient,to%20its%20fair%20share%20contribution." target="_blank">Climate Action Tracker</a>, these pushes have not made a difference, as India is still incredibly insufficient in combating climate change (as of 2024).</p>
