            <p>Energy, agriculture, industry, transportation, construction, and more. These are all examples of the different sectors of the countries of the world. Now, when you think of air pollution, the sector you may think will be at the top of the list is probably industry. You usually think of big smokestacks billowing large amounts of black smog into the air, destroying the landscape around it. While industry is on the top of the list, the top one may suprise you.<br><br>The top producer of air pollution of all the sectors is actually electricity generation (please note that this list does not include energy use for industrial activities as electricity generation but industry). Once you think about it, it makes sense. Everything that we use that requires electricity has to get that electricity from somewhere.</p>

                </div>
                <p>With that said, lets start with electricity air pollution. Why are they so high? Well, as I said earlier, nearly everything in modern-day life requires electricity. From our cell phones to our houses, everthing needs it to run. Due to this high demand, the countries of the world require very large amounts of infrastructure to power their tech. This would be fine, but most countries (especially less-developed ones) use non-renewable energy sources such as coal power plants or natual gas combustion, due to their cheap setup prices, in comparison to renewable energy sources having very high setup prices. But, non-renewable energy is much more expensive in the long run than renewable energy. So why do countries choose non-renewable over renewable? Its much easier to set up a larger amount of non-renewable power plants than it is to set up renewable ones, allowing for a higher electricity output.</p>
                <p>On top of this, humans can be a very short-sighted species when it comes to planning, so it is also due to people just not caring. On top of that, many renewable energy sources can be unreliable, such as wind turbines only working when its windy, solar panels only being useful if theres a lot of sunlight (but not too much, and they also require a LOT of land to be useful), hydroelectric dams causeing the same issues dams do along with killing fish and disrupting habitats, solar towers burning birds alive, and more. However, there have been many pushes and strides towards more renewable energy. For starters, constant research into renewable energy has made it more reliable, safer, and efficient. Along with this, technologies such as dry and wet scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators, laws like the Clean Air Act, agreements like the Montreal Protocol, and much more.</p>

            <p>Next up, industry. Industry is responsible for the production of the countless products we use on the day-to-day. The billowing smokestacks and large buildings I mentioned earlier were somewhat accurate. The burning of fossil fuels and natural gas for power and heat produce large amounts of pollution. The chemical reactions that produce chemicals, metals, and minerals in these facilities also produce a large amount of pollution. They also indirectly cause pollution due to the power plants they require for electricity often drawing that power from the combustion of fossil fuels. The indirect emissions account for the majority of the industrial sector's emissions. If this list considered the energy production required to run industrial in the energy section, then energy would be below agriculture.<br><br>Speaking of agriculture, lets talk about that next. Most directly, agriculutre produces a large amount of greenhouse gases due to animal waste and other bodily processes, such as cow rumination. There aren't many fixes for this problem besides simply reducing our animal product consumption. One fix, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (or CAFOs for short) are cheaper, emit less, and reduce land use, but they come at the expense of their own issus. This type of farming forces animals into incredibly small, tight spaces, leading to moral and ethical concerns and increased disease and virus transmission, leading to increased antibiotic use. CAFOs also require large sitting tanks for waste, which can runoff into nearby bodies of water, triggering a eutrophication event. Besides everything I just mentioned, agriculuture also produces a large amount of indirect emissions, as the processing phase of agriculture production uses the most energy out of all the steps, and transportation usually ends up being ~1500 miles (in the US specifically). This causes the same issue that industry has by requiring a lot of energy production to run.<br>Forestry emits a bit differently. And how it does is a little simpler. When logging companies use any logging strategy, the cutting down of the trees reduces the CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration ability of a forest. This means the forest will absorb less CO<sub>2</sub> overall, leading to higher global CO<sub>2</sub> levels as a result.<br><br>Next, transportation. This one's pretty simple. Boats, planes, trucks, cars, trains, and other forms of transportation are very widely used and often rely upon fossil fuels as power sources. Due to this, the transportation sector produces a large amount of CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, particulate matter, mercury, lead, NO<sub>x</sub>, VOCs, and much more. In addition to this, if thermal inversions occur above cities, the pollutants can become trapped near the surface, causing photochemical smog.<br><br>And finally, buildings and infrastructure. For starters, buildings often require heating and cooling capabilities, and depending on the size and location of the building, these can range in the required power and output. While buildings have many features such as insulation, using specific materials, and more. However, depending on the country, and especially in less-developed countries, this technology may be signifantly lower in quality or not be implemented at all. On top of this, older buildings that were built before such technology was created will not have it, leading to them being significantly less efficient when it comes to emissions. Construction of buildings and infrastrucure also releases a lot of emissions like VOCs, PM 2.5, and more. The impact of the building's construction can depend on the country, as some countries are much less safe with how they build buildings and may not care nearly as much about emissions as other countries. Buildings and infrastructure also require a large amount of energy to be able to do things like lighting, internet connection, heating, cooling, fire for cooking, and more. Buildins and infrastructure don't pollute nearly as much as the other sectors do, but there is still significantly more to be desired.</p>
