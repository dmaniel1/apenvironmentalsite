            <p>No matter the cause, climate change is all of our problem. But, certain countries cannot control how they pollute due to funding or resource issues. But, there are still countries that can and should try to cut down their own emmissions.<br>We need to fight to pressure and force the countries that can change policy and can assist other countries to do just that. With every country focusing on solving this problem, it will be solved quicker, more efficiently, and safer. History has shown time and time again that when the people of the world put aside their differences to solve issues, those issues get solved incredibly affectively.<br>Once countries are more focused on solving this problem, they can move onto trying to make the most polluting sectors do so less. There will most likely be more pushback in this area, as a lot of companies don't want to do research and implement less polluting forms of function as it can be expensive, but again, if everyone works together, it can be done.<br>So, why should you care? Because if you don't, this problem will not be solved, and we will continue on the same trajectory we are on today. If nothing changes, nothing will improve, and your future and the entire rest of humanity's future on this planet will be permenantly damaged and left in ruin. A future not fit for anyone forced upon the future generations of our species, left to pick up the pieces of the broken planet that you destroyed. Is that really what you want?</p>
