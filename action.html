            <p>In order to do the necessary action in order to save our planet, it will require all of our input and effort. But not everyone is on the same page, so let's fix that. We can't optimize the sectors such as energy and industry to be more green without the countries that contain these sectors to be focused on that. So, the first step is to get your country focused on combatting climate change. How? Same way people always have. Now, you don't have to pour your heart and soul into it, but don't stand by idly as misinformation and disinformation are spread about the internet and people dont understand the severity of the issue of the climate. Talk to people, correct them, tell them the facts. Get more people interested in the movement. Go to some protests, vote for politicians who will help (doubt there will be many though), and overall just try to make the movement more popular. If you don't want to pour your heart and soul into it, find someone who will.<br><br>Once you've gotten your own country on track, push for them to get others on track. Make them put sanctions on the countries who are not on track. Make them give resources and technology to countries that need it. In order to stop this, <i>everyone</i> needs to be on track. Everyone. The richer and more well off countries like the US and the EU and others need to provide resources to less-developed countries that may not be able to afford the startup price for most renewable energy sources. And while they're at it, make them put more money into research on renewable energy.<br><br>What about sectors? Now, since this can happen even if the government isn't 100% focused on improving our climate, improving the waste and pollution of sectors can happen alongside getting all the countries in order. Now, lets go over each sector.<br>First off, energy. Since most power plants either work on outdated technology or are outdated in their technology themselves, we can start by modernizing as many as possible. Not all of them, as depending on the country, it may be easier or harder to modernize them, but every plant modernized will lower the sector's overall pollution. In addition to that, putting stronger restrictions on the ambient air quality (especially in relation to the plants) will force the companies that run them to invent in order to cut down on their emissions. You can also subsidize the plants that do rely more heavily on pre-exhisting renewable power generation via money or other resources.<br>Next, industry. We can use similar tactics to energy, putting more restrictions on the companies that produce and subsidizing the ones that are more efficient. Often auditing the facilities industry uses will also help. Other more natural methods may also be used to cut down the emissions without actively forcing the sector itself to slow down production, such as planting a larger amount of trees overall and other natural filtration systems.<br>Agriculture and forestry. For the agriculture aspect, a few more sustainable techniques can be used. Since the majority of the problem is from livestock, the solution is pretty simple. Don't consume as many animal products. Unfortunately, people love animal products, so you can't just restrict the amount of animal products that can be produced and call it a day. This issue is more of a cultural issue than a production issue, especially in the case of countries like America. So, for starters, you can put more money into companies researching more realistic tasting plant-based meat products, especially beef. After that, you can educate people on the dangers of meat on the environment and present the plant-based beef instead. You can also give companies incentives for using plant-based meats over actual meat. However, for other animal products like dairy-based products and eggs, it <i>caaaaan</i> get a bit more complex. With dairy products it isn't, as a substitute for milk like almond milk or coconut milk can be used. But with eggs, its a little more complex. There are options like tofu and flaxseed for cooking alternatives, but not many for straight up egg replacements. But chickens aren't nearly as big of a problem as bigger animals like pigs and cows, so they don't need to be worried about as much. For forestry, we can't just stop cutting down trees. We need the lumber for building materials, and the requirement for housing and furniture grows larger and larger by the day. Using clear cutting is a start, but there is more that can be done. The heavy machinery that is used to extract wood are designed to be used for clear-cutting and are often used for selective cutting as well. So, using lighter machinery and clear-cutting methods will cut down on the emission levels of forestry.<br>Now, transportation. From cars to trains to planes, every form of transportation we have releases emissions. With the tech that doesnt go over water, the solution is pretty easy. For vehicles like cars and buses, replacing car-based infrastructure with more public transport will help a lot. Cars take up a large amount of space for only holding 1-6 people, while buses take up significantly less space while holding 1-70 people. Trains also cut down transportation time between cities by a very large margin compared to cars and also emit much less. In fact, the majority of modern trains run on electrified rails, emitting nothing at all. For planes and boats, the solution is pretty similar but kinda hard. This is due to the fact that electric planes and boats are less developed than electric technology for land vehicles. For example, the first type certified fully electric aircraft vehicle was the Velis Electro and was only certified in 2020, while fully electric cars have been in use since 1889. With enough research, however, the technology will get there and it will be worth it.<br><br>And finally, buildings and infrastructure. The energy issue is only due to power plants, which I already went over. So, the next part is the gas and other emissions due to construction and maintenance. For gas, houses can simply be built with electric stoves instead of gas ones. This also lowers the risk for gas leaks and house fires. Then, the construction and maintenance can be cut down in emissions by switching to lower-emission to zero-emission equipment, implementing dust-control practices, improving waste management practices, and monitoring air quality around construction zones.<br><br>And finally, money. Where would the money to do all of this come from? A lot of countries already have resources into this kind of stuff, so for a few, we don't have to worry. For the rest, they could divert money from their other investments and into research and implementation of this stuff. For example, the USA. Now, I know what I'm about to say will be a bit of a hot take, especially in the US, but we do not need to spend that much on the military. Look, I like cool military tech as much as the next guy. But we do not need to spend THAT much on it. Especially when we are 1: not at war, and 2: already have the most modern military in the world. Anyway, for the rest of the countries who can't afford such investments, the countries that can should give resources and money to them to be able to.</p>
            <!-- do countries, sectors, and where to get money from (for us, obviously defense budget [sorry guys i love the military as much as the next guy i think guns are cool but jesus fucking CHRIST we do not need to put that much money into it {especially since we ARENT ACTIVELY AT WAR (just sayin)}]) -->
